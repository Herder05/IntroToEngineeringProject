uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
Uses the Matlab Python Library, Flask, and Markup safe
installed libraries are included in the .venv enviroment
UPDATE VENV FILE WILL NOT UPLOAD TO GITHUB 
To run the code do create a enviroment in your ide and then run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Afterwords to run the code run "python -m flask run" in the terminal

If you want to run the file more than once you can create a launch.json file in visual studio code and select flask application
in the launch.json file use the following code:
{
    "name": "Python: Flask",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "flask",
    "env": {
        "FLASK_APP": "app.py",
        "FLASK_DEBUG": "1"
    },
    "args": [
        "run",
        "--no-debugger",
        "--no-reload"
    ],
    "jinja": true,
    "justMyCode": true
},

Currently the code does not input data but it can proccess any data it is handed
